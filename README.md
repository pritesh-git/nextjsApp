# Nextjs + Shadcn UI Project

Welcome to the Shadcn UI project repository! This repository serves as a playground for practicing various technologies and tools including Next.js, API development, Zod for data validation, Firebase for authentication, Firestore for database management, and Firebase Storage for file storage.

## Overview

In this project, we aim to create a robust and efficient web application using the Next.js framework, enabling server-side rendering for enhanced performance and SEO optimization. Leveraging Next.js's flexibility, we'll integrate APIs to handle dynamic data fetching and management.

Zod, a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library, will ensure data integrity and reliability throughout the application. By defining clear data structures, we can enhance code clarity and reduce the likelihood of runtime errors.

Firebase will play a crucial role in our project, providing authentication services to secure user data and interactions. Additionally, Firestore, a flexible, scalable database, will enable seamless data storage and retrieval, empowering real-time collaboration and synchronization across users.

Moreover, Firebase Storage will facilitate efficient file storage, allowing users to upload and access various media assets within the application.

## Features

- Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance.
- Integration of APIs for dynamic data management.
- Zod for robust data validation and type safety.
- Firebase for user authentication and security.
- Firestore for scalable database management.
- Firebase Storage for efficient file storage and retrieval.
