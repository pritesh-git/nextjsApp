# Nextjs + Shadow UI Project with MySQL

Welcome to the Shadow UI project repository! This revamped version explores the use of MySQL as the primary database solution, offering a robust and versatile alternative to Firebase.

## Project Structure

This project maintains a clean and organized structure, employing Next.js for server-side rendering and optimized performance. APIs facilitate seamless data interaction, while Zod upholds data integrity through rigorous validation.

## Key Technologies

- **Next.js:** The foundation of our project, providing server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing for a dynamic and efficient user experience.
- **APIs:** Act as intermediaries between the frontend and the database, handling data requests efficiently.
- **Zod:** Enforces data validation using TypeScript schemas, guaranteeing data consistency and reducing runtime errors.
- **MySQL:** The chosen database solution, offering a mature and feature-rich platform for data storage and management.

## Prerequisites

To embark on this development journey, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **Node.js and npm (or yarn):** The essential tools for project management and dependency installation. You can download them from https://nodejs.org/en.
2. **MySQL Database:** Set up a MySQL database server locally or on a cloud provider. Refer to the official MySQL documentation for installation and configuration instructions: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/.
3. **MySQL Connector:** Install the appropriate MySQL connector for Node.js using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install mysql
   ```

## Project Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd shadow-ui-project
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure MySQL Connection:**
   Create a configuration file (e.g., `config.js`) to store your MySQL database connection details:

   ```javascript
   module.exports = {
     host: 'your_mysql_host',
     user: 'your_mysql_user',
     password: 'your_mysql_password',
     database: 'your_mysql_database',
   }
   ```

   Replace the placeholders with your actual MySQL credentials.

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   Run the development server to launch the application:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
